# Experimental Features in Roo-Code

## What Are Experimental Features?

Experimental features are new capabilities in Roo-Code that are still being refined. They give you early access to powerful tools, but may occasionally have unexpected behaviors. You can enable them individually to try them out before they become standard features.

## Available Experimental Features

### 1. Unified Diff Strategy

**What it does**: Provides an alternative way for Roo to make changes to your code files.

**When to use it**: Try this feature if you notice Roo having trouble making changes to your files, especially larger or more complex ones.

**Potential benefits**:
- More reliable code changes
- Better handling of complex edits
- More detailed error messages when changes fail

**Considerations**:
- May occasionally make unexpected edits
- Slightly slower performance

### 2. Search and Replace Tool

**What it does**: Allows Roo to find and replace text across your files.

**When to use it**: Enable this when you need to make the same change in multiple places, like renaming a variable throughout your code.

**Potential benefits**:
- Make consistent changes across files
- Rename elements throughout a codebase
- Update formatting patterns

**Considerations**:
- Works best with specific search terms
- Preview changes before applying them

### 3. Insert Content Tool

**What it does**: Lets Roo add new content at specific locations in your files without changing existing content.

**When to use it**: This is helpful when you want to add new functions, import statements, or documentation to existing files.

**Potential benefits**:
- Add new code without modifying existing code
- Insert multiple blocks in different locations in one operation
- Maintain proper code formatting automatically

**Considerations**:
- Requires specifying precise insertion points

### 4. Power Steering Mode

**What it does**: Makes Roo follow instructions more strictly.

**When to use it**: Enable this feature when you need Roo to adhere very closely to specific guidelines or instructions.

**Potential benefits**:
- More consistent adherence to instructions
- Better results for specialized tasks
- Improved following of custom rules

**Considerations**:
- Uses more of your available context space
- May result in slightly slower responses

## How to Enable Experimental Features

You can enable experimental features through the Roo-Code settings:

1. Click the Settings gear icon in the Roo sidebar
2. Go to the "Experimental Features" section
3. Toggle the features you want to enable
4. Try them out in your workflow

## Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Enable one experimental feature at a time to understand its impact.

2. **Review changes carefully**: Always review changes made with experimental features before committing them.

3. **Provide feedback**: If you encounter issues or have suggestions, report them to help improve the features.

4. **Be cautious with important projects**: For critical work, stick with stable features or thoroughly test experimental ones first.

5. **Disable when not needed**: Turn off experimental features when you don't need them to ensure the most stable experience.

## Compatibility Notes

- Some experimental features work better with certain file types or project structures.
- Features may be updated or changed as they are refined.
- Experimental features may eventually become standard features if they prove valuable and stable.
