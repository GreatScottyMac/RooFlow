# MCP Server Integration Guide

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a way to extend Roo-Code with additional capabilities. It lets Roo connect to external tools and data sources, making it more powerful and versatile.

## Understanding MCP Servers

MCP servers act as bridges between Roo-Code and external systems. These servers can:

- Provide new tools for Roo to use
- Give access to additional data sources
- Connect Roo to other systems and APIs
- Perform specialized tasks that aren't built into Roo

For example, an MCP server might help Roo access a database, generate images, or connect to web services.

## Using MCP Servers

### Connecting to a Server

When you have an MCP server available:

1. It will appear in the "Connected MCP Servers" section of Roo-Code
2. Its status will show as "Connected" when ready to use
3. You can see the tools and resources it provides

### Using MCP Tools

When talking to Roo, you can ask it to use tools from connected MCP servers:

```
Can you use the weather tool from the weather-server to check the forecast for San Francisco?
```

Roo will:
1. Connect to the appropriate server
2. Run the requested tool with your parameters
3. Show you the results

### Using MCP Resources

MCP servers can also provide data resources:

```
Can you analyze the data from the analytics-server's monthly-report resource?
```

Resources represent data sources that Roo can access and work with.

## Server Status Indicators

MCP servers can have different statuses:

- **Connected**: Server is running and available
- **Connecting**: Server is in the process of establishing a connection
- **Disconnected**: Server is not running or encountered an error

If a server is disconnected, you might see an error message explaining why.

## Common MCP Server Types

### 1. Database Servers

These connect Roo to databases, allowing it to:
- Query your data
- Generate reports
- Analyze trends
- Update records

### 2. API Connectors

These give Roo access to external APIs:
- Weather services
- Stock market data
- Translation services
- Search engines

### 3. File and Document Processors

These help Roo work with different file types:
- PDF processing
- Image analysis
- Document conversion
- Data extraction

### 4. Specialized Tools

These provide domain-specific capabilities:
- Code analyzers
- Data visualizers
- Machine learning models
- Custom calculators

## Privacy and Security Considerations

When using MCP servers:

- Servers only have access to the data you explicitly share
- You'll be asked for permission before sensitive operations
- You can pre-approve trusted tools for convenience
- Server connections are local to your computer unless configured otherwise

## Configuration Options

You can configure MCP servers in your settings:

```json
// settings.json
{
  "roo-cline.mcp.servers": [
    {
      "name": "weather-server",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000",
      "autoConnect": true,
      "trusted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also pre-approve certain tools you trust:

```json
// settings.json
{
  "roo-cline.mcp.trustedTools": [
    "weather-server.get_forecast",
    "weather-server.get_current_conditions"
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with MCP servers:

### Connection Problems
- Check if the server program is running
- Verify the connection settings
- Look for error messages in the server status

### Tool Execution Errors
- Check if you provided the correct parameters
- Verify the server has access to necessary resources
- Look for error messages in the response

### Slow Performance
- Some operations may take time to complete
- Complex data processing might be slower
- Consider setting longer timeout values for intensive operations

## Getting Started with MCP

To begin using MCP servers:

1. Install or set up MCP server programs you need
2. Configure them in Roo-Code's settings
3. Connect to them through the Roo interface
4. Ask Roo to use their tools or access their resources

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Weather Information

```
Can you use the weather-server to tell me if I need an umbrella today in New York?
```

### Database Query

```
Use the database-server to show me the top 5 customers by revenue from last month.
```

### Document Analysis

```
Can you use the document-server to extract the tables from this PDF report?
```

### Code Analysis

```
Use the code-analyzer server to check my codebase for security vulnerabilities.
```

MCP servers expand what Roo can do for you, connecting it to the specific tools and data sources that matter for your work.
