# Managing Preferences and Settings in Roo-Code

## Overview

Roo-Code offers many ways to customize how the assistant works. This guide explains the different settings you can adjust to make Roo-Code work best for you.

## Types of Settings

### 1. General Settings

These settings control basic behaviors:

- **Language**: Choose which language Roo should speak and think in
- **Line Numbers**: Show or hide line numbers in code snippets
- **Markdown Formatting**: Enable rich formatting in responses
- **Auto-generate File Names**: Let Roo create descriptive file names

### 2. Security Settings

These settings control what Roo can do without asking permission:

- **Allowed Commands**: Commands Roo can run without confirmation
- **Auto-approve Operations**: Whether Roo needs permission for certain actions
- **Always Review Changes**: Whether to show changes before applying them
- **Security Level**: Overall security strictness

### 3. Experimental Features

These are cutting-edge features you can try:

- **Experimental Diff Strategy**: Alternative way for Roo to make code changes
- **Search and Replace Tool**: Tool for finding and replacing text
- **Insert Content Tool**: Tool for adding new content at specific lines
- **Power Steering**: Enhanced role definition adherence

## How to Change Settings

### Through the Settings Interface

The easiest way to change settings:

1. Click the Settings gear icon in the Roo sidebar
2. Browse through the available settings
3. Make your changes
4. Settings are automatically saved

### Through VSCode Settings

For more advanced configuration:

1. Open VSCode Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for "Roo-Code" or "roo-cline"
3. Adjust settings through the VSCode interface

### Through Settings JSON

For precise control and project-specific settings:

```json
// User settings.json or .vscode/settings.json
{
  "roo-cline.setting.name": value
}
```

## Key Setting Categories

| Confirm Dangerous Operations | Extra confirmation for risky actions |
| Show Diffs | Preview changes before applying them |

### Performance Settings

| Setting | Purpose |

## Project-Specific Settings

You can have different settings for different projects:

1. Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your project
2. Add Roo-Code settings prefixed with "roo-cline."
3. These settings will only apply when working in that project

Example for a project that needs TypeScript focus:
```json
{
  "roo-cline.preferredLanguage": "TypeScript",
  "roo-cline.allowedCommands": [
    "npm test",
    "npm run build"
  ]
}
```

## Recommended Settings for Specific Tasks

### For Code Review

```json
{
  "roo-cline.experiments.powerSteering": true,
  "roo-cline.showDiffs": true,
  "roo-cline.autoApproveOperations": "none",
  "roo-cline.confirmDangerousOperations": true
}
```

This configuration ensures Roo follows guidelines strictly and shows you changes before making them.

### For Rapid Development

```json
{
  "roo-cline.experiments.experimentalDiffStrategy": true,
  "roo-cline.experiments.insertContent": true,
  "roo-cline.allowedCommands": ["npm run dev", "npm test"],
  "roo-cline.autoApproveOperations": "safe"
}
```

This setup enables powerful tools and reduces interruptions for common tasks.

### For Learning

```json
{
  "roo-cline.markdownFormatting": true,
  "roo-cline.showLineNumbers": true,
  "roo-cline.autoApproveOperations": "none",
  "roo-cline.verboseExplanations": true
}
```

These settings optimize for clarity and explanation rather than speed.

## Tips for Managing Settings

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with default settings and adjust as needed
2. **Security First**: Be cautious about auto-approving operations
3. **Project-Specific**: Use different settings for different projects
4. **Regular Review**: Periodically check your settings as your needs change
5. **Experimental Features**: Try new features in non-critical projects first

## Troubleshooting Settings

If you encounter issues with settings:

1. **Settings Not Applied**: Try restarting VSCode
2. **Conflicting Settings**: Project settings override global ones; check for conflicts
3. **Reset to Defaults**: Use the "Reset to Defaults" button in settings
4. **Settings Location**: Check both global and project-specific settings files

By customizing Roo-Code's settings to match your workflow, you can make the assistant more helpful and efficient for your specific needs.
