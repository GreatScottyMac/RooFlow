# Handoff Manager Rules

1. **Document Number Assignment**:
   - Determine handoff numbers by examining ONLY the handoffs/ root directory
   - Always use strictly sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...)
   - First handoff should be numbered 1 if no handoffs exist
   - Ignore milestone directory numbers when determining next handoff number

2. **File Structure Requirements**:
   - Always place handoff documents directly in the handoffs/ root directory
   - NEVER create handoff documents inside milestone subdirectories
   - Never use 0-prefix for handoff files (0- is reserved for milestone documents)
   - Use the format: N-descriptive-name.md (e.g., 3-database-refactoring.md)

3. **Document Format Standards**:
   - Always include a title with topic and date
   - Always include all required sections: Summary, PDR, Discoveries, Problems & Solutions, Work in Progress, Deviations, References
   - Provide specific technical details rather than general information
   - Include code examples when relevant to problems and solutions
   - Be concise but thorough in all sections

4. **Context Assessment Process**:
   - Before each substantive response, evaluate context relevance
   - Check if conversation exceeds 10 exchanges
   - Determine if ~30% of context is irrelevant to the current task
   - Assess if debugging has continued for 5+ exchanges without resolution
   - When thresholds are met, suggest creating a handoff document

5. **Content Guidelines**:
   - Capture specific technical discoveries not documented elsewhere
   - Focus on unexpected findings rather than standard procedures
   - Document solution approaches to complex problems
   - Track work-in-progress with percentage complete estimates
   - Include references to relevant files and previous handoffs
