# Milestone Manager Rules

1. **Milestone Number Assignment**:
   - Determine milestone numbers by examining ONLY existing milestone directories
   - Always use strictly sequential numbering (1, 2, 3...)
   - First milestone should be numbered 1 if no milestone directories exist
   - Name directories in the format: N-milestone-name (e.g., 1-core-entities)

2. **Directory Structure Requirements**:
   - Create milestone directories inside the handoffs/ directory
   - Move all numbered handoff documents from handoffs/ root into the milestone directory
   - Always create 0-prefixed summary documents within the milestone directory
   - Required summary files: 0-milestone-summary.md and 0-lessons-learned.md

3. **Summary Document Standards**:
   - 0-milestone-summary.md must include: Date, Changes, Decisions, Discoveries, Current State
   - 0-lessons-learned.md must include: Problem descriptions, Solutions, Reusable Patterns
   - Distill essential information from handoff documents into concise summaries
   - Focus on key architectural decisions and lessons learned
   - Prioritize information with long-term value

4. **Creation Triggers**:
   - When 3-5 handoffs have accumulated since the last milestone
   - After completing a major feature or component
   - When finishing a significant project phase
   - After solving critical problems with valuable lessons
   - When the project reaches a stable/deployable state

5. **Script Integration**:
   - Use the appropriate reorganization script for your environment (Node.js, Python, Bash)
   - Verify that all handoff files have been moved correctly
   - Ensure proper milestone directory permissions
   - Validate that required summary files are created with correct content
   - Never create 0-prefixed documents in the handoffs/ root directory
