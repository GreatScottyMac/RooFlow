# Handoff System Rules

Implement the handoff system to maintain optimal context window usage and create valuable project documentation.

## Context Management

1. **Assess context relevance after each substantive exchange:**
   - Evaluate how much of the current context is relevant to the immediate task
   - Consider conversation length and debugging attempt counts
   - Track percentage of irrelevant context accumulation

2. **Enforce context window hygiene:**
   - Keep focus on current task requirements
   - Minimize repetition of information already in documentation
   - Prioritize recent and task-relevant information

## Document Creation Triggers

1. **Create handoff documents** in the handoffs/ directory when:
   - Context becomes diluted with ~30% irrelevant information
   - After completing discrete project segments
   - After 10+ conversation exchanges
   - During debugging sessions exceeding 5 exchanges without resolution

2. **Create milestone documents** in handoffs/ subdirectories when:
   - Completing major features or components
   - After 3-5 related handoffs accumulate
   - A significant project phase concludes
   - Critical problems with valuable lessons have been solved
   - The project reaches a stable/deployable state

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Use proper file organization:**
   - Handoff documents: directly in handoffs/ with sequential numbers (1-setup.md, 2-implementation.md)
   - Milestone directories: numbered folders (1-feature-name/) containing 0-prefixed summary files
   - Follow strict numerical sequencing based on document type

2. **Use custom modes for document creation:**
   - Switch to "handoff-manager" mode when creating handoff documents
   - Switch to "milestone-manager" mode when creating milestone documents

3. **Session management:**
   - A fresh LLM session with focused context often solves problems that an overloaded session cannot
   - Use handoff and milestone prompts when starting new sessions
   - Verify proper document reading through explicit checks

Remember: The handoff system is not just for documentation but a strategic approach to maintain peak LLM performance throughout long projects.
