# Captain Mode Implementation Plan

## Current Gaps Identified

1. Task Registry Missing
   - The documented taskRegistry.md file in Memory Bank is not implemented
   - No formal structure for tracking tasks and their status

2. Mode Configuration Missing
   - Captain mode not defined in cline_custom_modes.json
   - No specific role definition for captain mode
   - Missing file access permissions configuration

3. Mode Delegation System
   - No explicit implementation of delegation logic
   - Missing handoff protocols between modes
   - No progress tracking mechanism

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Configuration Updates

Captain Mode needs to be added to cline_custom_modes.json with the following structure:

```json
{
  "slug": "captain",
  "name": "Captain",
  "roleDefinition": "You are Roo's Captain mode, responsible for project orchestration, task division, and coordination between specialized agents.",
  "groups": [
    "read",
    "browser",
    "command",
    "mcp",
    "edit"
  ],
  "source": "global",
  "customInstructions": {
    "mode_collaboration": {
      // Mode collaboration settings
    },
    "mode_triggers": {
      // Mode transition triggers
    },
    "memory_bank_strategy": {
      // Memory bank integration
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Memory Bank Integration

#### Task Registry Template (taskRegistry.md)

```markdown
# Task Registry

## Active Tasks

| Task ID | Description | Assigned Mode | Status | Created | Updated |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|---------|---------|
| [ID]    | [Desc]     | [Mode]        | [Status]| [Date] | [Date]  |

## Completed Tasks

| Task ID | Description | Mode Chain | Completed | Notes |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| [ID]    | [Desc]     | [Modes]    | [Date]    | [Notes]|

## Mode Transitions

| Timestamp | From Mode | To Mode | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| [Time]    | [Mode]    | [Mode]  | [Why]  |
```

### 3. Mode Delegation Rules

1. Task Assignment Logic:
   - Architecture & Design → Architect Mode
   - Implementation → Code Mode
   - Testing & QA → Test Mode
   - Troubleshooting → Debug Mode
   - Research & Documentation → Ask Mode

2. Transition Triggers:
   - Task completion
   - Dependency resolution
   - Blocker identification
   - Resource requirements

3. Progress Tracking:
   - Task status updates
   - Mode transition logging
   - Completion criteria validation

## Implementation Steps

1. Create initial configuration files
2. Setup task registry system
3. Implement mode delegation logic
4. Create transition protocols
5. Test and validate functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. Automated task status updates
2. Enhanced progress visualization
3. Task dependency tracking
4. Performance metrics collection
5. Initial project scanning (see project-scan-feature.md)
   - Automated project structure analysis
   - Task discovery from existing codebase
   - Context building from project history
   - Integration with memory bank system
