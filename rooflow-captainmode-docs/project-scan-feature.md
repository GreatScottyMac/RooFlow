# Project Scan Feature Proposal

## Overview
Implementation of an initial project scan feature for the memory bank system to provide context and task awareness when RooFlow is introduced to an existing project.

## Functionality

### 1. Project Structure Analysis
- Scan directory structure and file types
- Identify key project components (src, tests, docs, etc.)
- Map dependencies and relationships between components
- Create project structure summary in memory bank

### 2. Task Discovery
- Scan for TODO comments and issue markers
- Identify incomplete or ongoing work
- Create initial task entries in taskRegistry.md
- Tag tasks with appropriate modes based on content

### 3. Context Building
- Parse documentation files for project context
- Analyze commit history for recent changes
- Create baseline context in activeContext.md
- Map technical debt and potential improvement areas

### 4. Integration Points
- Scan should be triggered via explicit command
- Results stored in memory-bank/projectScan.md
- Updates taskRegistry.md with discovered tasks
- Initializes activeContext.md with baseline data

## Implementation Plan

1. Add Project Scan Command
```bash
roo scan-project [--depth=<n>] [--include-history] [--output-format=<format>]
```

2. Scanner Components
- FileSystemScanner: Maps project structure
- TaskScanner: Identifies and categorizes tasks
- ContextBuilder: Creates initial context
- RegistryUpdater: Populates task registry

3. Output Documents
- projectScan.md: Scan results and analysis
- Initial taskRegistry.md entries
- Baseline activeContext.md

4. Integration with Existing Features
- Links with mode delegation system
- Updates task registry format
- Preserves existing context if present

## Success Criteria
- Accurate project structure mapping
- Meaningful task discovery
- Useful initial context
- Performance on large codebases
- Non-destructive to existing data

## Benefits
1. Faster onboarding to existing projects
2. Automated task discovery
3. Immediate context availability
4. Structured project understanding
