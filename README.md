# RooFlow Captain Mode Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the Captain Mode for RooFlow, developed by Martin. The Captain Mode serves as a project orchestrator and task manager, providing enhanced project coordination and workflow efficiency.

## 🎯 Overview

This implementation enhances the Captain Mode with:
- Advanced task dependency tracking
- Project metrics monitoring
- Automated mode transitions
- Comprehensive task registry system

## 🔧 Key Components

### Task Registry System
- Tracks active and completed tasks
- Manages task dependencies
- Records mode transitions
- Monitors project metrics

### Enhanced Mode Transitions
- Automatic switching between specialized modes
- Return triggers for task completion
- Post-return action handling
- Context preservation during transitions

### Project Metrics
- Task completion time tracking
- Mode transition analysis
- Dependency chain monitoring
- Progress visualization
