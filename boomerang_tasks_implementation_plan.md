### Implementation Plan: Boomerang Tasks in Captain Mode

1.  **Update Captain Mode Configuration:**
    *   Ensure the `captain` mode definition in `.roomodes` includes the necessary permissions and groups (read, browser, command, mcp, edit).
    *   Add a `memory_bank_strategy` section to the `captain` mode definition to specify how it interacts with the Memory Bank.
    *   Add `mode_collaboration` and `mode_triggers` to define how Captain mode interacts with other modes.

2.  **Implement Boomerang Task Logic:**
    *   Modify the Captain mode's core logic to handle task delegation and tracking using the Boomerang Tasks pattern.
    *   Implement a mechanism to monitor the status of delegated tasks and trigger transitions based on task completion, errors, or other events.
    *   Update the `taskRegistry.md` file to reflect the current status of tasks and mode transitions.

3.  **Update Task Registry:**
    *   Modify the `taskRegistry.md` file to include additional fields for tracking task dependencies, metrics, and mode transitions.
    *   Implement a mechanism to automatically update the task registry when tasks are created, completed, or transitioned between modes.

4.  **Validation:**
    *   Validate task delegation, progress tracking, and mode transitions while working on the implementation.
    *   Ensure that the Memory Bank is properly updated and that the context is preserved across sessions.

5.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update the Captain Mode documentation to reflect the changes made during the implementation process.
    *   Include migration guides, API documentation, and usage examples.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **Configuration Updates:**
    *   Update `.roomodes` to include Captain mode definition with correct permissions and groups.
    *   Update `.clinerules-captain` to define the memory bank strategy and mode collaboration settings.

2.  **Core Logic Implementation:**
    *   Modify `src/roo.ts` to implement the Boomerang Tasks functionality.
    *   Implement task delegation logic based on task type and mode expertise.
    *   Implement task status tracking and mode transition triggers.

3.  **Task Registry Updates:**
    *   Modify `memory-bank/taskRegistry.md` to include additional fields for tracking task dependencies, metrics, and mode transitions.
    *   Implement a mechanism to automatically update the task registry when tasks are created, completed, or transitioned between modes.

4.  **Validation:**
    *   Validate task delegation, progress tracking, and mode transitions while working on the implementation.
    *   Ensure that the Memory Bank is properly updated and that the context is preserved across sessions.

5.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update the Captain Mode documentation to reflect the changes made during the implementation process.
    *   Include migration guides, API documentation, and usage examples.
