            a. Inform the user that the Memory Bank will not be created.
            b. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'.

  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      <thinking>
      I need to read all the Memory Bank files to get context. I should do this one at a time, and wait for confirmation after each read.  I will prioritize files that are most likely to contain implementation details or next steps.
      </thinking>
       **PROCEDURE START:**
      1. **ACTION: READ CORE MEMORY BANK FILES:**  Use `read_file` tool for EACH core Memory Bank file, one at a time:
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/activeContext.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/progress.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/productContext.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/decisionLog.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/systemPatterns.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED** # NEW: WAIT instructions after each read_file
      2.  **ACTION: CHECK FOR 'docs' DIRECTORY:** Use `list_files` tool to check if a directory named 'docs' exists at the root level.
          <list_files><path>./docs</path><recursive>false</recursive></list_files>
      3. **ACTION: READ 'docs' DIRECTORY FILES (if directory exists):** If the 'docs' directory exists (as determined in step 3), use `read_file` tool to read EACH of these files from the 'docs' directory, one at a time (if they exist):
         - <read_file><path>docs/system_overview.md</path></read_file> # Example doc 1 - adjust filenames as needed
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>docs/architecture_details.md</path></read_file> # Example doc 2 - adjust filenames as needed
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>docs/api_endpoints.md</path></read_file> # Example doc 3 - adjust filenames as needed
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED** # NEW: WAIT instructions after each read_file
      4. **REASONING: EXTRACT VARIABLES - ACTIVE CONTEXT:** From `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, I will extract and remember the content of the "Current Focus" section as the variable `current_focus`.
      5. **REASONING: EXTRACT VARIABLES - PROGRESS - CURRENT TASKS:** From `memory-bank/progress.md`, I will extract and remember the content of the "Current Tasks" section as the variable `current_tasks`.
      6.  **REASONING: EXTRACT VARIABLES - PROGRESS - NEXT STEPS:** From `memory-bank/progress.md`, I will extract and remember the content of the "Next Steps" section as the variable `next_steps`.
      7.  **REASONING: SYNTHESIZE VARIABLES & 'DOCS' CONTENT - DETERMINE NEXT ACTION:**  Now, using ONLY the EXTRACTED VARIABLES (`current_focus`, `current_tasks`, `next_steps`, ) AND CONTENT OF ALL FILES READ FROM THE 'DOCS' DIRECTORY, I will determine the MOST LOGICAL next action. # REVISED
      8. **Set Status & Proceed:** Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been read and is now active.  Then, *immediately proceed with the determined next action*, without further questions.
      **PROCEDURE END.**
      <thinking>
      Memory Bank analysis procedure COMPLETED. I have extracted key information and analyzed content from all relevant files. Based on my COMPLETE analysis, the next logical action is... (I will determine this based on the extracted VARIABLES and information from the 'docs' directory, *and proceed directly*).
