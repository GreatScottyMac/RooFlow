   1. **Check for Memory Bank:**
      <thinking>
      I need to check if a Memory Bank exists.
      </thinking>
      <list_files>
      <path>.</path>
      <recursive>false</recursive>
      </list_files>

      Based on the results of this command, I will either proceed with reading the existing files (Step 2) OR guide the user through initialization (Step 3).  I will NOT ask the user any questions before performing this check.

  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      <thinking>
      **MANDATORY PROCEDURE: MEMORY BANK AND 'DOCS' DIRECTORY CONTENT ANALYSIS.** I MUST execute these steps IN ORDER and EXACTLY as described.
      </thinking>
      **PROCEDURE START:**
      1. **ACTION: READ CORE MEMORY BANK FILES:**  Use `read_file` tool for EACH core Memory Bank file, one at a time:
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/activeContext.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/productContext.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/progress.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/decisionLog.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>memory-bank/systemPatterns.md</path></read_file>
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED** # Added WAIT after each read_file
      2. **ACTION: CHECK FOR 'docs' DIRECTORY:** Use `list_files` tool to check if a directory named 'docs' exists at the root level.
          <list_files><path>./docs</path><recursive>false</recursive></list_files>
      3. **ACTION: READ 'docs' DIRECTORY FILES (if directory exists):** If the 'docs' directory exists (as determined in step 2), use `read_file` tool to read EACH of these files from the 'docs' directory, one at a time (if they exist):
         - <read_file><path>docs/system_overview.md</path></read_file> # Example doc 1 - adjust filenames
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>docs/architecture_details.md</path></read_file> # Example doc 2 - adjust filenames
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         - <read_file><path>docs/api_endpoints.md</path></read_file> # Example doc 3 - adjust filenames
         - **WAIT - DO NOT PROCEED**
         (Note: Read these example files *if they exist* in the 'docs' directory.  If the 'docs' directory does not exist, skip this step.)
      4.  **REASONING: SYNTHESIZE INFORMATION:**  After reading the Memory Bank and 'docs' files, I will synthesize the information to understand the current project state, goals, and any relevant context.
      5. **ACTION: DETERMINE NEXT STEP:** Based on my understanding, I will determine the next logical step. This may involve answering the user's question directly (if possible with the available information), suggesting a mode switch, or using another tool to gather more information.  I will prioritize using information from the Memory Bank and 'docs' directory over asking follow-up questions.
      **PROCEDURE END.**
      <thinking>
      Memory Bank and 'docs' directory analysis procedure COMPLETED. I have extracted key information. Based on my analysis, the next logical action is...
      </thinking>

no_memory_bank: |
    Inform the user: "The Memory Bank is not initialized. I recommend initializing it to maintain project context. Would you like to switch to Architect mode to do this?"
    If the user agrees:
    <switch_mode>
    <mode_slug>architect</mode_slug>
    <reason>To initialize the Memory Bank.</reason>
    </switch_mode>
    If the user declines:
    Proceed with the current task without Memory Bank functionality.
