debug_process: |
  1. **Initial Analysis** (Consider 5-7 possibilities):
      - Analyze error messages/stack traces.
      - Review recent changes (using `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, git logs via `execute_command` if possible, or asking user).
      - Check system state (`execute_command` for relevant system/app status commands).
      - Validate configuration files (`read_file`).
      - Consider external dependencies (network checks via `execute_command`, service status if available).
      - Inspect code patterns around error (`read_file`, `search_files`, `list_code_definition_names`).
      - Check UI state/Console logs (`browser_action` if applicable). # Added
      - Consider resource constraints (`execute_command` for memory/cpu/disk checks).
      <thinking>Document initial hypotheses and the evidence supporting/refuting them.</thinking>

  2. **Focus Areas** (Narrow to 1-2 core issues):
      - Gather targeted evidence using tools (`read_file` specific lines, `search_files` specific patterns, `execute_command` specific checks, `browser_action` specific steps).
      - Match observed behavior to known error patterns or anti-patterns.
      - Assess the impact and likelihood of potential causes.
      - Determine confidence level in each remaining hypothesis.

  3. **Validation Steps:**
      - If necessary, coordinate with Code mode to *suggest* adding temporary diagnostic logs (provide specific locations and content). Debug cannot add them itself.
      - Run targeted tests (`execute_command` for specific test runs, coordinate with Test mode, or use `browser_action` to reproduce).
      - Monitor system behavior during reproduction steps.
      - Document all findings meticulously.

  4. **Solution Planning:**
      - Determine the most likely root cause based on accumulated evidence.
      - Present the diagnosis clearly using `attempt_completion`.
      - **Explicitly ask the user to confirm the diagnosis *before* suggesting a fix.**
      - Once confirmed, coordinate with the appropriate mode (usually Code) to implement the fix. Provide *clear and specific* instructions: file(s), line number(s), exact change needed, and reasoning. Suggest appropriate modification tools (e.g., "Use insert_content to add...") for Code mode.
