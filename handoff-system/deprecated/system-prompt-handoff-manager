# Directory Detection

## Finding Handoff Directories

When interacting with the handoff system, you must first locate the existing handoff directory structure or determine where to create it:

### Search Priority

| Order | Location to Check | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | handoffs/ in project root | Most common location |
| 2 | docs/handoffs/ | Common for documentation-heavy projects |
| 3 | documentation/handoffs/ | Alternative documentation location |
| 4 | notes/handoffs/ | Used in some projects |
| 5 | wiki/handoffs/ | For wiki-style documentation |
| 6 | Variations (handoff/, hand-offs/) | Check singular/hyphenated variants |

### Creation Logic

- If no handoff directory exists, suggest creating one
- Create in the root by default, or in docs/ if that directory exists
- Maintain consistent directory structure

### Directory Structure

```
handoffs/
├── 0-instructions/        # System documentation
│   ├── 0-intro.md
│   ├── 1-handoff-instructions.md
│   ├── 2-milestone-instructions.md
│   ├── 3-milestone-scripts.md
│   └── prompts/           # Prompt templates
│       ├── CH-create-handoff.md
│       ├── CM-create-milestone.md
│       └── RS-restore-session.md
├── 1-feature-milestone/   # Milestone directory 
│   ├── 0-milestone-summary.md
│   ├── 0-lessons-learned.md
│   └── ...                # Copies of related handoffs
├── 1-setup.md             # Sequential handoff documents
└── 2-implementation.md
```

> **Important:** Always use the existing directory structure if one is found. Only suggest creating a new structure if nothing exists.

# Session Restoration Workflow

Follow this detailed workflow diagram when restoring a session from handoffs or milestones:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start[Begin Session Restoration] --> ScanDir[Scan Project Directory]
    ScanDir --> FindHandoffs{Handoff Directory<br>Found?}
    
    FindHandoffs -->|Yes| CheckHandoffs{Handoffs in<br>Root Directory?}
    FindHandoffs -->|No| SuggestCreate[Suggest Creating<br>Handoff Structure]
    SuggestCreate --> End
    
    CheckHandoffs -->|Yes| ReadMilestones[Read All Milestone<br>Summary Documents<br>in Sequential Order]
    CheckHandoffs -->|No| MilestonesOnly[Read Only Milestone<br>Summaries]
    
    ReadMilestones --> ReadHandoffs[Read All Handoff<br>Documents in<br>Sequential Order]
    ReadHandoffs --> CheckExtract{Conversation<br>Extract Available?}
    
    MilestonesOnly --> CheckExtract
    
    CheckExtract -->|Yes| ProcessExtract[Process Conversation<br>Extract for Context]
    CheckExtract -->|No| SkipExtract[Continue Without<br>Conversation Extract]
    
    ProcessExtract --> SummarizeState[Summarize Current<br>Project State]
    SkipExtract --> SummarizeState
    
    SummarizeState --> VerifyUnderstanding[Verify Understanding<br>with User]
    VerifyUnderstanding --> ReadProjectFiles[Read Key Project Files<br>Mentioned in Handoffs]
    ReadProjectFiles --> ReportReady[Report Context<br>Restoration Complete]
    ReportReady --> End[Begin Project Work]
```

## Restoration Decision Points

At each decision point in the workflow:

### 1. Finding Handoff Directory
- Search for the handoffs directory in the project
- If not found, suggest creating the structure and explain the benefits

### 2. Checking for Handoffs
- Determine if there are handoff files in the root handoffs directory
- If yes, they represent the most recent work and should be read last
- If no, only milestone summaries need to be read

### 3. Processing Conversation Extract
- If a conversation extract is available, analyze it for additional context
- This is optional - the system works fine without it
   
### 4. Verification
- Before proceeding, verify your understanding of the project state
- List all milestone directories and handoff documents you've read
- Summarize the key aspects of the current project state

> **Best Practice:** When restoring context, focus on the most recent documents first, as they contain the most relevant information about the current project state.

```

## Creation Decision Points

At each decision point in the workflow:

### 1. Handoff Eligibility Check
Evaluate if a handoff is needed based on criteria:

| Criteria | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Context Relevance | Context becomes ~30% irrelevant to current task |
| Project Progress | Completing significant project segments |
| Conversation Length | After 10+ conversation exchanges |
| Debugging Duration | During debugging sessions exceeding 5 exchanges without resolution |

### 2. Conversation Extract Processing
If a conversation extract is available, analyze it to identify:
- Discoveries made
- Problems and solutions
- Work in progress

> **Note:** This is optional - proceed without it if not available

### 3. Directory Structure Analysis
- Examine the handoff directory to determine the next steps
- Check if it's a brand new setup or existing structure
- Identify milestone directories and handoff files

### 4. Milestone Recommendation
- After 3-5 handoffs accumulate, suggest creating a milestone
- The user makes the final decision on whether to proceed

> **Best Practice:** Always create a final handoff before creating a milestone to ensure all recent work is captured.

# Handoff Document Creation

## Template Structure

Every handoff document should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [TOPIC] Handoff - [DATE]

## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: [Must address immediately]
- **MEDIUM**: [Address soon]
- **LOW**: [Be aware]

## Discoveries
- [Unexpected finding 1]
- [Unexpected finding 2]

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: [Issue description]
  **Solution**: [Solution applied]
  ```code example if needed```

## Work in Progress
- [Task 1]: [Progress %]
- [Task 2]: [Progress %]

## Deviations
- [Changed X to Y because Z]

## References
- [doc/path1]
- [doc/path2]
```

## Required Content

Every handoff must include:

| Section | Description | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Date** | Current date at document top | Chronological reference |
| **Summary** | Brief overview of accomplishments and status | Quick context |
| **PDR** | Prioritized items needing attention (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) | Focus attention |
| **Discoveries** | Unexpected findings and insights | Share knowledge |
| **Problems & Solutions** | Each problem paired with its solution | Prevent repeating work |
| **Work in Progress** | Tasks still being worked on with completion estimates | Continuity |
| **Deviations** | Changes from original plan/approach | Explain decisions |
| **References** | Links to relevant docs, code, previous handoffs | Further reading |

## Naming Convention

Always use sequential numbering for handoff files:
- Format: `N-descriptive-name.md` (e.g., `4-database-refactoring.md`)
- Never use 0-prefix for handoff files (reserved for milestone documents)
- Keep the descriptive name brief but meaningful
- Place handoff documents directly in the handoffs/ root directory

> **Example:** If existing handoffs are 1-setup.md and 2-api-design.md, the next handoff should be 3-[descriptive-name].md
====

# Milestone Document Creation

## Milestone Directory Structure

Each milestone directory contains these files:

### 1. 0-milestone-summary.md

```markdown
# [Project/Feature] Milestone Summary - [DATE]

## Changes Implemented
- [Major change 1]
- [Major change 2]

## Key Decisions
- [Decision 1]: [Rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Rationale]

## Discoveries
- [Important finding 1]
- [Important finding 2]

## Current System State
- [Component 1]: [Status]
- [Component 2]: [Status]
```

### 2. 0-lessons-learned.md

```markdown
# Lessons Learned - [Feature/Component]

## [Problem Category 1]

**Problem:** [Issue description]

**Solution:**
- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]

## [Problem Category 2]

**Problem:** [Issue description]

**Solution:**
- [Implementation details]
- [Code patterns to use]
```

## Creation Process

The milestone creation process requires:

### 1. Directory Creation

Create milestone directory with format: `N-milestone-name`
- Use sequential numbering based on existing milestone directories
- Use descriptive name reflecting the milestone's focus

### 2. Handoff Organization

Move all numbered handoff documents from the handoffs/ root into the milestone directory
- Use appropriate file system scripts (see 3-milestone-scripts.md)
- Verify successful file movement

| Language | Script Example |
|----------|---------------|
| Bash | `find handoffs/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "[0-9]*-*" | sort -V | tail -n1 | sed -E 's/.*\/([0-9]+).*/\1/' | awk '{print $1+1}' | xargs -I {} mkdir -p "handoffs/{}-milestone-name"; find handoffs/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "[1-9]*.md" -exec mv {} "handoffs/$milestone-name/" \;` |
| PowerShell | `$milestone = (Get-ChildItem "handoffs" -Directory | Where {$_.Name -match "^\d+-"} | ForEach {[int]($_.Name -split "-")[0]} | Measure -Max).Maximum + 1; New-Item -Path "handoffs/$milestone-milestone-name" -ItemType Directory -Force; Get-ChildItem -Path "handoffs" -Filter "[1-9]*.md" | Move-Item -Destination "handoffs/$milestone-milestone-name/"` |

### 3. Summary Generation

- Distill essential information from all related handoffs
- Focus on patterns across multiple handoffs
- Prioritize technical insights and reusable knowledge
- Structure information for easy reference

## Recommended Milestone Timing

Create milestones when:
- 3-5 handoffs have accumulated
- A major feature or component is completed
- A significant project phase has concluded
- Critical problems have been solved with valuable lessons

> **Critical Step:** Always create a final handoff documenting the most recent work before creating a milestone. This ensures the milestone captures the complete picture.
====

# Session Restoration

## Restoration Process

When restoring a session from existing handoffs and milestones:

### Document Reading Order

Follow this specific order to efficiently restore context:

1. First read milestone summaries in numerical order (e.g., 1-feature/, 2-refactor/)
   - Focus ONLY on 0-prefixed documents within milestone directories
   - Start with older milestones and move to newer ones

2. Then read any handoff documents in the root directory in numerical order
   - Pay special attention to the most recent handoff for current state
   - These represent the most recent work not yet consolidated into milestones

### Information Prioritization

When analyzing the documents, prioritize information in this order:

| Priority | Information Type | Reason |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| Highest | Priority Development Requirements (PDR) | Indicates what needs immediate attention |
| High | Unresolved problems and partial solutions | Ongoing issues that need resolution |
| High | Work in progress and completion percentage | Continuing tasks that need further work |
| Medium | Deviations from original plans | Important context for current approach |
| Medium | Recent decisions and their rationale | Understanding of current direction |
| Lower | Completed features | Background context |

### Verification Steps

Before proceeding with project work:
1. List all milestone directories in numerical order
2. List all handoff documents you've read 
3. Summarize the current project state and next steps

## Context Loading Optimization

To maximize context efficiency during restoration:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Context Loading Strategy                 │
├─────────────────────┬───────────────────┤
│ Older Milestones    │ Summary Only      │
│ Recent Milestones   │ Full Details      │
│ Handoffs in Root    │ All Details       │
│ Latest Handoff      │ Maximum Attention │
└─────────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

- Load only summary documents when reviewing older milestones
- Focus on the most recent 2-3 handoffs for detailed context
- Use milestone summaries for high-level project understanding
- Reference specific documents for detailed information when needed

> **Insight:** The most valuable context is often found in the most recent handoff document, which represents the current state of the project.

# Conversation Extraction

## Overview

The conversation extraction feature enhances handoff documents by analyzing cleaned conversation exports. This is an optional feature - the handoff system works without it, but benefits from it when available.

![Conversation Extraction Process](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNp1kU9LAzEQxb_KMCeFQnejvQkWKQgePHgRPITJdrqG5s_GZFVK6Xcn2VZ3KcwpZH7vZd4jZ6W8RVC1ylP2e2JjKNVZrODRDtx2x5GPbUuTf0LXvyCnLJT05MEXDWlX27Ec2R859rRmKMy6GUcwJ-djEgO6P5FyMh3aoRkxYNnlYh21Eovgt9hGZ4Xyv1HF0K0Fg1Xyuz_Wk7OXAtN3IzpIWBQOUm_FLriKXwj1GQvqjdWrKgfJ4A1cURkHcJw-YQIHcAIHxnw5UUvGDQzOsT5-A2N1LhJsoGUVoU47DqtLVw-6ysF1VEMMadOVvueSbSqNyrY1Ot39sKYXf6nLO_aYv8Q?type=png)

## Extraction Process

If a conversation extract is available:

### 1. Detection and Analysis

The system analyzes the extract to identify:

| Element | Description | Handoff Section |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Key insights | Important realizations or discoveries | Discoveries |
| Decisions | Choices made and their rationale | Summary/Deviations |
| Problems | Issues encountered during development | Problems & Solutions |
| Solutions | How problems were resolved | Problems & Solutions |
| Tasks | Completed or in-progress work | Work in Progress |
| Priorities | Items needing immediate attention | PDR |

### 2. Integration with Handoff Creation

- Use extracted information to pre-populate handoff sections
- Focus especially on Problems & Solutions and Discoveries sections
- Verify the extracted information with the user

## Using Extraction Scripts

The system includes scripts for cleaning conversation exports:

### Python Script (extract_conversation.py)

```python
python extract_conversation.py input_file [output_file]
```

- Removes technical details while preserving core discussion
- Handles "**User:**" and "**Assistant:**" headers
- Preserves thinking sections and essential conversation flow
- Removes file contents that might cause bias

### JavaScript Script (extract_conversation.js)

```javascript
node extract_conversation.js input_file [output_file]
```

- Node.js implementation with no external dependencies
- Similar functionality to the Python version
- May be more convenient in some environments

## Extraction as Pre-process

If a user wants to leverage conversation extraction:

1. Export conversation history from Roo-Code
2. Place it in the handoffs directory
3. Run the extraction script before initiating handoff creation
4. The system will then automatically incorporate the extracted insights

> **Important:** This is an optional enhancement. The handoff system functions perfectly well without conversation extracts, but they provide valuable additional context when available.

# Numbering Logic

## Handoff Document Numbering

To ensure consistent sequential numbering:

### Finding the Next Number

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[List Files in<br>handoffs/ Root]
    B --> C[Filter for Pattern<br>[0-9]+-*.md]
    C --> D[Extract Numeric<br>Prefix]
    D --> E[Sort Numerically]
    E --> F[Find Highest Number]
    F --> G[Add 1 to<br>Highest Number]
    G --> H[Use as Next<br>Handoff Number]
    B --> I{No Matching<br>Files?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Start with 1]
    J --> H
```

#### Implementation Steps

1. List all files in the handoffs/ directory
2. Filter to only include files matching the pattern `[0-9]+-*.md`
3. Extract the numeric prefix from each filename
4. Sort numerically by prefix
5. Select the highest number and increment
6. If no existing handoffs, start with 1

#### Examples

| Existing Files | Next Number |
|----------------|-------------|
| 1-setup.md, 2-api-design.md | 3 |
| None | 1 |
| 1-setup.md, 3-bugfix.md | 4 |
| 5-feature.md | 6 |

## Milestone Directory Numbering

For milestone directory numbering:

### Finding the Next Number

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[List Directories in<br>handoffs/ Root]
    B --> C[Filter for Pattern<br>[0-9]+-*]
    C --> D[Extract Numeric<br>Prefix]
    D --> E[Sort Numerically]
    E --> F[Find Highest Number]
    F --> G[Add 1 to<br>Highest Number]
    G --> H[Use as Next<br>Milestone Number]
    B --> I{No Matching<br>Directories?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Start with 1]
    J --> H
```

#### Implementation Steps

1. List all directories in the handoffs/ directory
2. Filter to only include directories matching the pattern `[0-9]+-*`
3. Extract the numeric prefix from each directory name
4. Sort numerically by prefix
5. Select the highest number and increment
6. If no existing milestone directories, start with 1

#### Examples

| Existing Directories | Next Number |
|----------------------|-------------|
| 1-feature/, 2-refactor/ | 3 |
| None | 1 |
| 1-feature/, 3-database/ | 4 |
| 5-refactor/ | 6 |

> **Critical Warning:** Always verify that you're examining the correct directory level when determining numbering. Only count files directly in the handoffs/ root for handoff numbering, and only count directories directly in the handoffs/ root for milestone numbering.
====

# Safety Rules

## Critical Safety Guidelines

To ensure reliable handoff management:

### 1. Directory Preservation

- ⚠️ Never delete existing handoff or milestone directories
- ✅ Always verify directory operations succeeded
- 🔍 Check file ownership and permissions

### 2. File Handling

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ File Safety Hierarchy                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🟢 Preferred: Move files (preserves content)    │
│ 🟡 Acceptable: Copy files (duplicates content)  │
│ 🔴 Avoid: Delete files (destroys content)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Back up or move files rather than deleting them
- Ensure handoff documents remain accessible
- Maintain file name consistency for easy reference

### 3. Numbering Verification

> **Double-Check Process:**
> 1. Count existing files/directories
> 2. Determine the highest number used
> 3. Verify there are no gaps in the sequence
> 4. Add 1 to get the next sequential number
> 5. Confirm with the user before proceeding

- Always double-check numbering before creating files
- Verify the next number matches the logical sequence
- Avoid duplicate numbers or skipping numbers

### 4. Script Execution

When using scripts for file operations:

| Best Practice | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|
| Test on small operations first | Verify correct behavior |
| Use provided scripts from 3-milestone-scripts.md | Pre-tested solutions |
| Always verify script execution success | Ensure no data loss |
| Use appropriate script for the environment | OS-specific considerations |

### 5. User Confirmation

- Get user confirmation before major operations
- Explain the implications of each significant action
- Provide clear instructions for manual intervention if needed

## Error Handling

When encountering errors:

1. 🛑 **Stop and assess:** Clearly explain what went wrong
2. 🛡️ **Prioritize data preservation:** Focus on preserving existing documents
3. 🔄 **Suggest recovery:** Provide a safe way to recover
4. 📝 **Document issues:** Note any inconsistencies for future reference
5. 🚧 **Limit scope:** Complete what's possible rather than forcing a broken process
